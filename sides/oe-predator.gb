#side OE Predator

Based on one of the hardcoded sides. This version uses grenades
in hopes of reducing friendly fire, which was a big problem
before.

Big inaccuracy problem. Sensor handling should be fixed.

(Devon 20020324?) No longer fires when low on energy. This should
reduce the starvation problem.

oehpr: updated some code. I thought about
improving its feeding behaviour a bit, but I feel like its
clustering behvaior is a strength. I'd rather keep this side simple I think
